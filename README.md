## Intro to Node


__Node.jsÂ®__ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

A __node_modeule__ is basically a lego block of code. Everything in a node application is modular, meaning it is made up of many different smaller parts that work towards the end functionality.

__NPM__ stands for Node Package Manager. It's just a tool that allows us to easily acces the node module ecosystem and add them to our project.
Example node_module: [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)

Every node app has a __package.json__ , which is the master file that  keeps track of all node maodules your project cares about.

to add a `package.json` to your project, run the commmand`npm init` , and accept all defaults.

`git add -A`

`git commit -m "introductory definitions for node"`

`git push orgin master`

### Node HTTP Server

We used the node module HTTP to build a simple web server, that we can then run and connect to using the web address: http://localhost:3000/ .
To run the server use the command `node index.js`

```js
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(function(request, response){
  response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
  response.end('Hello world!');
}).listen(3000, function(){
  console.log('App is listening on port 3000')
});
```

----
### Express Web server
[Express API](http://expressjs.com/)
To add express node module to our application:
`npm install --save express`
To ensure it was added succesfully, check your `package.json` for:
```js
"dependencies": {
  "express": "4.15.3"
:}
```

This also gives us a ton of code we do not care to track in our Github, in the `node_modules/` folder. To ignore this code;

`touch .gitignore`
add `node_module/` to `.gitignore`
